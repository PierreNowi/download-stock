# Using BatchGetSymbols to download financial data for several tickers

# function GetSymbols from the CRAN package quantmod in order to download end of day trade data for several stocks in the financial market. 
# The problem in using GetSymbols is that it does not aggregate or clean the financial data for several tickers. 
# In the usage of GetSymbols, each stock will have its own xts object with different column names and this makes it harder to store data from several tickers in a single dataframe.

# Package BatchGetSymbols is my solution to this problem. 
# Based on a list of tickers and a time period, BatchGetSymbols will download price data from yahoo finance and organize it so that you donâ€™t need to worry about cleaning it yourself.

# Organizes data in a tabular format, returning prices and returns
# A cache system was implemented in version 2.0, meaning that the data is saved locally and only missings portions of the data are downloaded, if needed.
# All dates are compared to a benchmark ticker such as SP500. You can choose to ignore ticker with a high number of missing dates.


if (!require(BatchGetSymbols)) install.packages('BatchGetSymbols')
library(BatchGetSymbols)

# set dates
first.date <- Sys.Date() - 60
last.date <- Sys.Date()
freq.data <- 'daily'
# set tickers
tickers <- c('FB','MMM','PETR4.SA','abcdef')

l.out <- BatchGetSymbols(tickers = tickers, 
                         first.date = first.date,
                         last.date = last.date, 
                         freq.data = freq.data,
                         cache.folder = file.path(tempdir(), 
                                                  'BGS_Cache') ) # cache in tempdir()

# After downloading the data, we can check the success of the process for each ticker. 
# Notice that the last ticker does not exist in yahoo finance and therefore results in an error. 
# All information regarding the download process is provided in the dataframe df.control:                                                 
print(l.out$df.control)

# Moreover, we can plot the daily closing prices using ggplot2:
library(ggplot2)
 
p <- ggplot(l.out$df.tickers, aes(x = ref.date, y = price.close))
p <- p + geom_line()
p <- p + facet_wrap(~ticker, scales = 'free_y') 
print(p)


# Downloading data for all tickers in the SP500 index

# The package was designed for large scale download of financial data. 
# An example is downloading all stocks in the current composition of the SP500 stock index. 
# The package also includes a function that downloads the current composition of the SP500 index from the internet. 
# By using this function along with BatchGetSymbols, we can easily import end-of-day data for all assets in the index.

# In the following code we download data for the SP500 stocks for the last year. 
# The code is not executed in this vignette given its time duration, but you can just copy and paste on its own R script in order to check the results. 
# In my computer it takes around 5 minutes to download the whole dataset.
